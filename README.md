# WORK IN PROGRESS
Tapeout expected: 09/2024

Work based on:
* MomoRC ELRS true diversity receiver ( [MomoRX1](documentation/221022_MomoRC_MOMORX_manual_v1.0.pdf) ) 
* MomoRC MomoFC1 Flight Controller ( [MomoFC1 manual](documentation/2022_MomoFC1_manual.pdf) )

# Overview
MoGliFC is an STM32H743-based flight controller for quadcopters ('drones') as well as aircraft with wings.
Winged aircraft typically require servos to be connected to the flight controller while copters
typically have no such requirement. 

### Quadcopter and Wing
MoGliFC addresses both use-cases by providing a scored extension board for the servo connectors which 
also holds the BEC for the servos. When removed, the signal outputs remain on the flight controller and 
are available e.g. as GPIOs, UARTs or PWM outputs.
To enable a "Full Stack" solution for drones incorporating also a dedicated ESC daughter board, the design 
goal of MoGliFC is such that off-the-shelf ESC boards can be used. (outlook: custom ESC board for MoGliFC with advanced features)    

### CAN-FD and Debug
The second extension option is a larger frame which allows the MoGliFC to be placed in a BOPLA ALUBOS housing
with the USB interface as well es the CAN/CAN-FD externally available turning the MogliFC into a general
purpose CAN-FD interface. This second extension also holds a SWD (single wire debug) interface for easy debugging.
